# Anguar Programming
1. Create Component
    - Data Binding
        - Interpolation
            - Binding public data member of the component to the Read-Only UI element as expression
            - Syntax
                - {{<PUBLIC-DATA-MEMBER-OF-COMPONENT>}}
                - read-only UI elements
                    - div, p, span, label, td, th, etc.
                - E.g.
                    - <div>{{name}}</div>
                        - The 'name' is the public data member of the class    
            - The interpolation is parsed as Expression and render as HTML element
            - if the interpolation contains Numeric mathematical expression then Angular will invoke JavaScript 'evel()' function to eveluate the expression in interpoilation            
        - Property Binding
            - Binding public data members of the component with attributes of HTML elements
            - Syntax:
                - [<ATTROIBUTE-NAME>]="<PUBLIC-DATA-MEMBER-OF-COMPONENT>"
                - e.g.
                    - <input type="text" [value]="message">
                        - 'message' is public data member of the component
                - Most of the standard attributes if HTML UI elements are parsed by Angular for Property Binding
                    - e.g., [value], [href], [disabled], [hidden], etc.         
        - Event Binding
            - Binding an event of the HTML element to the public metghod of the component
            - Syntax
                - (<EVENT-NAME>) = "F1()"
                    - THE 'F1()' is a public function of Component
                - e.g.
                    - <input type="button" (click)="display()">    
            - If the event of UI element wants to pass the attribute values of the UI element to the method, then use '$event' object
                - The '$event' is a JavaScript object that represents the event occured on Element
                    - $event.target represent the UI element on which an event is raised
                    - $event.target.<ATTRIBUTE-NAME>
                        - will be used to read the value of attribute of UI element on whihc an event is raised      
            - (click), (change), (blur), (keyup), etc.               
        - Two-Way Binding
            - Combination of Property Binding + Event Binding
            - Syntax
                - [(ngModel)]="<PUBLIC-DATA-MEMBER-OF-COMPONENT>"
                - ngModel, is a standard Angular 'attribute directive' (custom attribute for HTML elements) used for Two-Way Binding
                - To Execute 'ngModel', the NgModule must import 'FormsModule' in its 'imports' array from the @angular/forms package  
                - ngModel will listen to the default event of UI element on which it is applied
                    - e.g. <input> element has default event as 'keyUp' that results in 'change' event
                - This default event will invoke 'ngModelChanged' event on ngModel directive and will read changed value of UI element  
                - THis updaed value of the bound property will be passed to the Component
                - The component will call its 'ngOnChanges' internal method and will accept updated value from UI
                - This value will be processed (if any logic iss written for it), this value will be send back to UI to elements where this property is bound (with property binding / two-way binding / interpolation)   
    - Angular Directives
        - Directive
            - A class that is used to define a custom re-usable UI or custom bechaior for exisitng HTML element
        - Component Directive
            - Each component is Directive and this component can be used as custom HTML UI for reusability
        - Atrribute Directive
            - It is a type that is used to define a custom behavior for exisditng HTML element
                - ngModel, formGroup, formControlName     
        - Structural Directive
            - Used to dynamically add/remove HTML UI elements from DOM    
            - e.g.
                - *ngFor, this execute a for..of loop to generate DOM elements based on collection       
                - *ngIf, the if condition, evaluate a if statement to add or remove HTML element 
                - *ngSwitch ngSwitchCase     
    - Optimize component using following features
        - Do not write complex or time-consuming code in Constructoer
            - Lifecycle methods
                - ngOnChange(), OnChnage interface
                    -  executed when the property is changed with Two-Way binding 
                - ngOnInit(), OnInit interface
                    - Executed 'only once' after the constructor is executed
                    - Use this method to write logng running process logic
                        - Heavy Collection Operations  
                        - Calls to External Services
                        - One-Time Event Subscription
                - ngDestroy()
        - If the Complex UI e.g. select, ul, table are repeated in components's UI template then think of creating custom re-usable complex elements
            - UI Composition is a process of dividing a UI in-to small and autonomous Angular Components
                - Parent Component contains Multiple Child Components
                    - the selector of child component is used in HTML template of parent component
                - Parent Components instantiate child components explicitely
                    - Use @ViewChild to instantiate the child comoponent in parent
        - Eliminate the hard-coding of propeties on UI for structural directive                 
    - Communication Across Components
        - Component as Reusable-Component-Ditective
            - Parent - Child Components
                - Child component MUST have @Input decorated property with get/set. This will be used for property binding by parent component
                - CHild component MUST have @Output decorated event of the type EventEmitter<T>. This will bubble-up (aka emit) event with values from child to parent of the type 'T' 
            - Component Reusability
                - COnsideratoins for Re-usable component
                    - UI requirements for HTML definitions
                    - Properties for accepting data from parent
                    - Events using which data will be emitted to parent



2. Angular Forms
    - Reactive Forms
        - @angular/forms
            - ReactiveFormsModule
                - The class that is used to manage the <form> tag as Reactive Forms by mapping it implicitely to ngForm directive of Angular 
                - This must be imported in 'imports' array of NgModule
            - This class will manage lifecycle of following classes
                - FormGroup
                    - The class derived from 'AbstractControl' class.
                    - AbstractControl, represents each UI element on HTML template
                    - FormGroup
                        - Represent the <form> that will accpet data from UI and manipulate it
                        - It is collection of FormControls which is editable elements mapped with public properties of Model class 
                        - The '[formGroup]' attribute directive will be used to map the FormGroup imstance to the <form> tag
                        - The 'value' property of FormGroup represent the data posted from <form> that map with the Model class
                            - formGroup.value map with an instance of the Model class mapped with the formGroup
                            - e.g. If Model class is 'Product' then formGroup.value will represent an isnatnce of Product class
                        - The 'setValue()' method that can be directly passed with an instance of Model class
                            - e.g. formGroup.setValue(this.product)    
                - FormControl
                    - The class that map a single public property of Model class with the single editable UI element
                        - formControl.value will represent each property from the Model class
                        - formControl.setValute(), accept a value for single property of the Model class
                    - The  'formControlName' a attribute directive that map the FormControl with UI element 
                - Validators
                    - Used to provide Static methods for Input Field Validations containing the 'formContolName' attribute
                        - requred(AbstractControl)
                        - requredTrue(AbstractControl)
                        - pattern(string | RegEx)
                        - min(number) / max(number)
                        - minLength(number) / maxLength(number)
                        - email(AbstractControl)
                        - nullable()
                        - compose(Validation Array to apply validations on UI element)
                    Note: All validators accepting 'AbstractControl' are directly linked with UI element using formControlName and these mathods will be executed as callback    
                - To evaluate and display validation errors use the FormGroup object model(?)
                    - Check if the UI element / formControl is changed
                        - <formGroup>.controls.<formControlName>.dirty
                    - Check if the value is invalid after the formControl is changed
                        - <formGroup>.controls.<formControlName>.invalid OR !<formGroup>.controls.<formControlName>.valid        
                    - Check which validator is failed
                        - <formGroup>.controls.<formControlName>.errors.<Validation-Rule-Failed> 
                        - e.g. 
                            - <formGroup>.controls.<formControlName>.errors.pattern   



    - Validation
        - Custom Validations
            - The method must be static
            - The method can accept eithe AbstractControl or premptive type as input parameter
            - Since the method return 'null' if value is value or will return JSON object for invalid value, the return type of the method must be 'any'
                - {invalid:true}, {valid:false}, {even:false}

3. Angular Services
    - Utilities
    - Pub/Sub Communication across Components using Angular Services
    - HTTP Calls
        - CRUD Operations
        - Token Based Secure Calls

4. Single Page Application (SPA)
    - Routing

        - Child Routing
        - Lazy Loading  
    - DEMO: for Route Guards
            - Auth Guards   

5. Creating Custom Directives
    - These are the custom attribute directives used for defining custom behavior on HTML elements of Angular Components
        - These will be interactive based on Property Binding
        - These will be activated based on events 
    - Attribute Directives are used for Property Binding by defining the @Input Decorated property in the Custom Directive class
    - The Class must be decorated with the @Directive Decorator from @angular/core
    - The The custom directive must have a 'selector' that will be applied on the HTML element
    - The directive must define methods to activate / deactivate directive based on methods applied with @HostListener decorator from @angular/core       
        - @HostListener
            - This is used to listen events raised on UI and accorindly execute methods to activate and deactivate custom directive
    - The directive is constructor injected in custome directive class using following two classes
        - ElementRef
            - @angular/core
            - This represents the HTML element on which the directive is applied
        - Renderer2
            - @angular/core
            - This represents the rendering of HTML element when the directive is activated
        - These injected classes will be resolved by BrowserModule             
    - The custom directive must be declared in 'declarations:[]' array of NgModule            

6. Testing
